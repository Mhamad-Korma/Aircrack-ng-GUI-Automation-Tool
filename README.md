•  Developed a user-friendly GUI application in C# for automating the Aircrack-ng suite, a popular Linux tool
   for network security.

•  The application allows users to input a handshake file and a wordlist, and seamlessly generates and executes
   the corresponding Aircrack-ng command for WPA/WPA2 handshake cracking.

•  Additionally, the tool includes a feature for creating custom wordlists, providing options to specify the
   number of words, password length, and character types (including capital letters and special characters).
